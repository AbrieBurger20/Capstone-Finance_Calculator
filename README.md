**Introduction**

This task called Finance Calculator was part of HyperionDev's Software Engineering bootcamp. For this task we had to assume we were approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. With the help of user input we used this finance calculator to calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month.

**Installation**

To install the finance calculator, clone the repository

**Usage**

Once you have the finance calculator on your laptop, just click run and see how it works.

**Contribute**
